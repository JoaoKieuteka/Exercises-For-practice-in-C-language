This is some exercises I did just for learning some basics in C programming language, they were wrote all in Portugese but I'm just too lazy to translate it LOL.

Exercise 1 - Guess the number:

Here I did a simple algorithm that randomizes a number, stores it in a Int type variable and the user has to guess the number by typing It on a console, if the guessed number is above the correct one, the software prints "Your guess is above the correct number, try it again", the same applies if the guess is below the correct value, but this time it prints "Your guess is below the correct number", if the user guess it right the algorithm stops and prints a congratulations message.
