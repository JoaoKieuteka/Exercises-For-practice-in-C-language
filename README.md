This is some exercises I did just for learning some basics in C programming language, they were wrote all in Portugese but I'm just too lazy to translate it LOL.

Exercise 1 - Guess the number:

Here I did a simple algorithm that randomizes a number, stores it in a Int type variable and the user has to guess the number by typing It on a console, if the guessed number is above the correct one, the software prints "Your guess is above the correct number, try it again", the same applies if the guess is below the correct value, but this time it prints "Your guess is below the correct number", if the user guess it right the algorithm stops and prints a congratulations message.

Exercise 2 - Vowels:

This one is about couting the vowels in a text that the user types on a console, here the user types a text with a 100 characters limit, the algorithm stores it in a array named "TextoUsuario" with the fgets function, and uses a for loop that counts how many of each vowels are in the text that the user typed in, in the end the console prints out the number of each vowel containing in the text.
